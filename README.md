# Description 


The replace() method replaces each matching occurrence of a substring with another string.

The strip() method removes any leading (starting) and trailing (ending) whitespaces from a given string.

The lstrip() removes characters from the left based on the argument (a string specifying the set of characters to be removed).

The rstrip() method returns a copy of the string with trailing characters removed (based on the string argument passed).
