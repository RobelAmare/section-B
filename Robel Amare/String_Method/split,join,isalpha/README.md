## Description

The split() method breaks down a string into a list of substrings using a chosen separator.

The string join() method returns a string by joining all the elements of an iterable (list, string, tuple), separated by the given separator.


The isalpha() returns:

    True if all characters in the string are alphabets (can be both lowercase and uppercase).
    False if at least one character is not alphabet.
